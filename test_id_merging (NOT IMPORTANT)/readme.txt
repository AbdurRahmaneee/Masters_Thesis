it was created to allign the flow rates with the prepared extracted feature samples. It could be done manually as well without this script.

1. first we copied the test_ids from the prepared file to obtain the sequence and it is named file_2
2. in file_1 we put the flowrates with test_id with their dafault sequence.
3. we run the script and it creates a new file name "merged_file" where the flow rates are positioned with their test id and according to the sequence.
4. Then we can just copy this flow rate sequence and past it the feature extracted csv file created by automated feature extraction code.

NOTE: if it is confusing please ignore. it only saved me some time and it is not inherently involved in the thesis work.
